  Assume you are designing a real-life system, that will be used by real users.
  The application should contain 2 types of users: Restaurants and Customers
 Pages to be developed-
‘Registration’ pages - Different registration pages for Restaurants & Customers. Capture
customer’s preferences (veg/non-veg) during registration.
‘Login’ pages - Single/different login pages for restaurants & customers.
‘Add menu item’ page - A restaurant, once logged in, should be able to add details of new food
items (including whether they are veg or non-veg) to their restaurant’s menu. Access to this
page should be restricted only to restaurants.
‘Menu’ page - There should be a page that displays all the available food items along with which
restaurants have them and a ‘Order’ button. This page should be accessible to everyone,
irrespective of whether the user is logged in or not. Expected functionality on click of the
'Order' button-
- Only customers should be able to order food by clicking the ‘Order’ button.
- It’s optional to implement cart functionality.
- If the user is not logged in, then he/she should be redirected to the login page.
- If a user is logged in as a restaurant, then the user should not be allowed to order the food.
‘View orders’ page - Restaurant should be able to see the list of all the customers who have
ordered from their restaurant along with the food items they have ordered
